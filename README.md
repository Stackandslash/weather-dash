## Instructions

During your first visit to the page, the app will appear mostly blank. When you enter a search option corresponding to a city, however, it will display the current weather, as well as the five day forecast for that city. It will also add that city to a list under the search bar for easy access, newest entries at the bottom, as specified. 

When you next come back, the page will also remember the last city you searched for, and pull it up automatically, while keeping the rest of your search history clear to avoid clutter.

Current weather information includes:

* City name and date

* Weather icon

* Temperature

* Humidity

* Wind speed

* Color-associated UV Index

Forecast information includes:

* Date

* Weather icon

* Expected Average Temperature

* Expected humidity

In the future, this app can be expanded to provide more detail, a saved list of favorites, or the ability to differentiate cities that share the same name.
